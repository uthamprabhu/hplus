        <p>We’re committed to creating products that <em>defy convention</em>, and inspire our customers with pride and trust. In fact, we guarantee <a href="#products">every product</a> we sell. If you’re not 100 percent happy with your purchase, you can return it during the first 60 days, <em>no questions asked</em>.</p>
        <p>Philanthropy is extremely important to us. In fact, <em>each employee volunteers</em> for organization of his or her choice, on the clock, for two hours each week. We know that doing good, breeds more doing good, and we’re happy to <em>promote a cycle</em> of volunteerism that just keeps on giving.</p>
